# Kotlin
The Kotlin example is built and run using Gradle.

    ./gradlew computeAverageIncome

# Rust
You need at least the version 1.46.0 of rustc 
to build this example. 

To build and run the Rust application 
you have to move to its project directory:
    
    cd src/main/rust/compute_average_income

Running the slow development Rust version:

    cargo run

Running the fast Rust version:

    cargo run --release
